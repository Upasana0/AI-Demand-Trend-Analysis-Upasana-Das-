# AI-Based Demand Trend Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical retail sales data to identify demand trends and predict future sales using machine learning techniques. The aim is to support better decision-making in retail inventory and sales planning.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges in forecasting product demand accurately. Poor demand estimation can lead to excess inventory or loss of sales. This project analyzes historical sales data to identify demand patterns and predict future demand using machine learning.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify demand patterns  
- Detect relationships between sales and influencing factors  
- Build a machine learning model to predict future demand  

## Dataset
- Retail sales dataset (Superstore Sales Data)
- Stored in Excel format
- Key features used:
  - Sales
  - Quantity
  - Discount
  - Profit
  - Shipping Cost

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis between numerical features
- Feature selection based on correlation
- Supervised machine learning using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using RMSE

## Machine Learning Model
- Model used: **Linear Regression (baseline)** **Random Forest Regressor (prototype)**
- Type: Supervised learning 
- Target variable: Sales

## Results
- Demand patterns were identified through exploratory analysis
- Sales demand was predicted successfully using the machine learning model
- Model performance was evaluated using RMSE

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Files
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) – complete implementation
- Project Report
- PPT with voice explanation
- Requirements file

## Notes
The project was developed entirely using Jupyter Notebook. All analysis, modeling, and evaluation are included in the notebook.
