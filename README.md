# AI-Based Demand Trend Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical retail sales data to identify demand trends and predict future sales using machine learning techniques. The aim is to support better decision-making in retail inventory and sales planning.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges in forecasting product demand accurately. Poor demand estimation can lead to excess inventory or loss of sales. This project analyzes historical sales data to identify demand patterns and predict future demand using machine learning.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify demand patterns  
- Detect relationships between sales and influencing factors  
- Build a machine learning model to predict future demand  

## Dataset
- Retail sales dataset (Superstore Sales Data)
- Stored in Excel format
- Key features used:
  - Sales
  - Quantity
  - Discount
  - Profit
  - Shipping Cost

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis between numerical features
- Feature selection based on correlation
- Supervised machine learning using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using RMSE

## Machine Learning Model
- Model used: **Linear Regression (baseline)** and **Random Forest Regressor (prototype)**
- Type: Supervised learning 
- Target variable: Sales

## Results
- Demand patterns were identified through exploratory analysis
- Sales demand was predicted successfully using the machine learning model
- Model performance was evaluated using RMSE

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Files
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) – complete implementation
- Project Report
- PPT with voice explanation
- Requirements file

## Ethical Considerations & Responsible AI

This project follows ethical and responsible AI practices while analyzing and predicting retail sales data.

### Data Privacy and Confidentiality
The dataset used in this project does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) such as customer names, contact details, or sensitive personal data. Only aggregated and anonymized retail data is used to ensure privacy and data protection.

### Bias and Fairness
The model is trained on historical retail sales data, which may contain existing patterns or biases. To minimize unfair bias, the project avoids using sensitive attributes and focuses only on business-related numerical features. The predictions should be used as supportive insights rather than as the sole basis for critical decisions.

### Model Transparency and Explainability
Linear Regression was chosen because it is a transparent and interpretable machine learning model. This allows users to understand how input features influence sales predictions, promoting explainable and responsible AI usage.

### Responsible Use of Predictions
The predictions generated by this model are approximate and subject to uncertainty. They should be used for analysis and planning purposes only and not as absolute or final outcomes in real-world retail scenarios.

### Limitations and Accountability
The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and completeness of the dataset. Further validation, additional features, and continuous monitoring are required before deploying this system in a real-world production environment.

## Notes
The project was developed entirely using Jupyter Notebook. All analysis, modeling, and evaluation are included in the notebook.
